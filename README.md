# Reservations-App Instructions

This project was for college and was made in Visual Studio with C++.

If you want to see more and try it out, you can do so by downloading the project file. I'm sorry it has to be in a compressed file, but Git wouldnâ€™t let me upload it because of the number of files.

For more instructions, refer to the text file named "User Manual".
If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
